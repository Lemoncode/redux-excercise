# Intro

The goal of this sample to is get started with redux.

We will get as starting point an application that displays a list of github members that
belongs to an organization (in the starting excercise is hardcoded to _lemoncode_), and 

# Excercise

- Start with the stating implementation that is located under the folder *00_start*.

- Let's install the needed dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

- And start the application to check that everything is working as expected.

```bash
npm start
```

- If we check the current implementation we are getting a list of members belonging to lemoncode
organization, that's nice but we would like to let the user to be able to type the name of the 
orgnization he wants, hit ok and display the list of members for that organization.

- Some hints to develop this:
  - Follow a progressive approach.
  -
